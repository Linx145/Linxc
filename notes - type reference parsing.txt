considering the following advanced type reference
using namespaceA;

namespaceB::namespaceC::type::subtype

where namespaceB is a sub-namespace of A


To find subtype, we would need to:
realise namespaceB is not in the global namespace
find namespaceB in used namespaceA;
find namespaceC in used namespaceB;
find type in used namespaceC;
find subtype in type

We could use a method of recursion where namespaces that the function is in, as well as the global namespace and using'd namespaces are all appended to a vector, which is then used to check for sub-namespaces that contain the current identifier, or types that contain the current identifier.

Upon finding a type that contains the current identifier, we search for subtypes that contain the next identifier.

If none are found for either step, we decide that the type does not exist.

One more issue is the existence of #includes. A type may be defined in a file that is not #included. We need to make sure that we do not just scan the entire namespace reflection database, but just the #included files.

Another way to check is to first parse the summation of namespaceB::namespaceC::type::subtype, which is translated to the C type name, namespaceB_namespaceC_type_subtype. Then, variants of the C typename are created, one for each using'd namespace or namespace the code itself is in.
Then, we query a database of types from Linxc header files included in this file, which is built up with each #include. If it contains the C type name, we return it, otherwise, we throw an error.
